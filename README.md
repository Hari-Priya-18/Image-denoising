# Image-denoising
Satellite Image Denoising using OpenCV
This project demonstrates the use of image denoising techniques to improve the quality of satellite images using Python and OpenCV.
Satellite images often contain noise due to atmospheric interference, sensor errors, or transmission disturbances. Denoising helps improve visual clarity and is essential for accurate interpretation and downstream tasks like object detection and classification.

This project applies:
- Gaussian Blur :- for general noise reduction
- Bilateral Filter :-  for edge-preserving smoothing
